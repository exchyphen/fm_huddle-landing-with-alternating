## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- React

### What I learned

Lots of practice with structuring, layouts, and general CSS. Good improvement on creating reusable/common CSS classes.

### Continued development

Possibly restructuring and renaming CSS classes. Now that we know to use more wrappers/containers especially for the larger view sizes, we can more appropriately name them.
